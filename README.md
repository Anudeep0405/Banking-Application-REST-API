# Banking-Application-REST-API
This project demonstrates how to build a REST API for a simple banking application using Spring Boot 3, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL.


Highlights

🚀 Build a banking application using Spring Boot 3.

🛠️ Utilize Spring Data JPA for database interactions.

💾 Connect to a MySQL database for data storage.

📦 Create an account entity with JPA annotations.

🔄 Implement REST APIs for account management (add, get, deposit, withdraw).

🔍 Test APIs using Postman for interaction verification.

🗑️ Implement delete functionality to remove accounts.

Key Insights

🌟 Spring Boot Integration: Leveraging Spring Boot simplifies the setup process, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than configurations, which is particularly beneficial for rapid 
application development.

🔗 Data Persistence with JPA: Using Spring Data JPA streamlines database interactions, reducing boilerplate code and enabling easier CRUD operations through repository interfaces.



🛡️ API Design: Implementing RESTful principles promotes a clean and structured API design, making endpoints intuitive and easy to use for client applications.



📊 Testing with Postman: Utilizing Postman for testing APIs enhances debugging capabilities, allowing developers to ensure that each endpoint works as expected before deployment.


💡 Error Handling: Proper error handling, such as checking for account existence and insufficient funds, is crucial for a robust application, improving user experience and system reliability.



📈 Scalability Considerations: Building a banking application with a microservices architecture can facilitate scalability, allowing individual components to be developed and deployed independently.


🔍 Real-world Applications: This project showcases coding techniques and highlights the real-world applications of Spring Boot and JPA in financial software development, making it relevant for aspiring 
developers.
